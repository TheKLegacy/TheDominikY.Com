<h1>Oops, Shoulda Boosted</h1>

<p>HTMX is really cool. It's simple to use and doesn't have a ton of options. I still managed to overlook some fantastic features.</p>

<p>I was thinking about adding some sort of routing so you could link to the blog or resume page for example, and then I found out about the ht-boost option</p>

<p>It always you to add hx-boost to links and load the new page with ajax rather then a whole page load. This is probabably what I should of done. Just with a htmx calls to load shared stuff like the headers and footers.</p>
