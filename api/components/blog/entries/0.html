<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is my first blog post. htmx and node js made the logic for this quite easy. However, it was quite annoying to get the sidebar the div this post is in to be on the same line.</p>

<p>The age old problem of centering and putting things on the same line will never be solved will it?</p>
