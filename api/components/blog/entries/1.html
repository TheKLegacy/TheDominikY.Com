<h1>About my website</h1>
<p>So you want to know more about my website?</p>
<p>It's a pretty simple portfolio site. It was originally made with Jeykll when I was in college as part of a class. Four years later (today) It needed a refresh, so I remade the entire thing with htmx and updated the content</p>
<p>For the backend all I just made a small node.js express API. earlier today it was just to seve html for htmx, but now it does some cool stuff with the blog system. Check out my next post to learn about that.</p>
