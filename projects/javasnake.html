<p>Made in AP Computer Science with David Ruth and Charles Jacob. A simple Snake game that keeps track of the winner in a two player mode (Kinda like slither.io) or classic single player. This game also implments music in java. Use arrow keys or WASD to move, 1 and 2 to change player modes and R to restart.</p>
